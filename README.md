For this project we had to refactor an existing website for web accessibility. Meaning, i went through the HTML code and cleaned up the format leaving it in a logical formation. For example replacing some of the div tags with section tags to clearly note where the different sections start and end. Adding alt tags to the images so the user would now what the image was, although the image itself was broken. Made sure the company name was displayed on the tab window. Also organized the heading tabs to be in a correct sequential order.  When done with this changes making the website and the code itself more user friendly.
